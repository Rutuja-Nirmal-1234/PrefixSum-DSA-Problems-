# Prefix Sum – DSA Problems in C#

This repository contains solutions to Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems based on the Prefix Sum technique, implemented in C#.

## Each solution includes:
1. Problem statement
2. Clean and well-commented code
3. Step-by-step logic using prefix sums
4. Time and space complexity analysis

## Purpose of this repository:
1. Practice and strengthen problem-solving skills using the Prefix Sum technique
2. Build a strong understanding of cumulative sums and range-based queries
3. Learn how prefix sums are used with arrays, subarrays, and matrices
4. Share code that is simple, readable, and easy to revise before interviews

## How to run:
1. Clone the repository  
2. Open the project in any C# IDE or editor (e.g., Visual Studio, Rider, VS Code with C# extension)  
3. Build and run the program
